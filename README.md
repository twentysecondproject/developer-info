## VATSIM Developer Information

Welcome to the VATSIM Developer Information. This repository has been made so that developers can open new discussions as an alternative to the forum, and also access wiki information on our services

Discussions can be opened for making suggestions, reporting issues/bugs, and asking
questions.

## Wiki

The Wiki is available [here](https://github.com/vatsimnetwork/developer-info/wiki) or by clicking the Wiki tab in the navigation bar above

## How to create a discussion

Go to the "Discussions", once you are on the page, click "New discussion".

## Disclaimer

This is mostly for VATSIM Technical Questions, not general support. Some examples of
what should be posted here:

- VATSIM API Questions
- VATSIM Data Server Questions
- VATSIM Connect/OAuth Questions
- Suggestions for Technical Services (Data Server, Connect, etc)
- Bug Reporting for **VATSIM** Technical Services

Examples of what should be posted on the forum instead:

- How to setup model matching
- How to setup your audio settings
- Help on connecting to the network

Anyone can create, and reply to threads. Do not expect an immediate reply from
VATSIM Developers, we are all volunteers, and it may take some time to get a reply.

If you find your answer before we reply, simply respond saying you found the solution,
and explain what you did. It may be useful for others having the same issue!
